title: "Rspotify: Access to Spotify API via R"
---


This package allows you to connect R to Spotify's API and get information about Songs, Albuns, Artists and Users.

This is an experimental package built up with functions that I've created to attend my specific needs (meaning I wasn't really concerned with errors different than ones I got when it was written). Please, use it with caution. 

So far I haven't uploaded a stable version to CRAN but you can download from GitHub using devtools, type:

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("tiagomendesdantas/Rspotify")
```


In order to access many of the functions you need a authenticated token. You can get one accessing <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/"> this link</a> to create a Spotify app and get app_id, client_id and client_secret. (Don't forget to put http://localhost:1410/ in Redirect URIs)  



```r
keys <- spotifyOAuth("app_id","client_id","client_secret")
```


To get informarion about a specific user:
```r
getUser("t.mendesdantas",token=keys)
```


To search for an artist:
```r
searchArtist("Regina+spektor")
```

To get a dataframe with related artists:
```r
getRelated("Regina+spektor")
```
